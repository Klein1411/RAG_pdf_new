1 BRAINSTORMING
This guide contains a number of exercises and templates for both individual and group brainstorming.
Regardless if you’re doing this alone or with your team, the following rules should help you make the most of
your brainstorming session:
•
Focus on quantity over quality.
•
Selectively apply constraints to keep the session focused.
•
Don’t prune ideas as you brainstorm.
•
Never finalize or commit during a brainstorming session.
•
Look at all sources generated for inspiration.
•
Use a whiteboard (and take pictures of each whiteboarding session).
•
Take breaks.
Free Writing
Freewriting has long been a great way to get the creative juices flowing. According to a study from Harvard
Business School, regular workplace journaling is one of the best ways to improve professional performance.
Not to mention, research shows that occasionally writing by hand improves both memory and creativity. It’s
no wonder that writers have long used freewriting to break through writer’s block. Freewriting will bring
perspective to your work and narrow down the focus of your day.
Freewriting can be a great starting point for bigger brainstorming activities, but it’s best when conducted
with a little bit of structure. As mentioned, freewriting tends to generate the best results when you write on
paper, as creativity tends to spark better than when using digital tools. You can also conduct this activity with
a group, giving participants the time to write, then afterward, come together to discuss the individual
outcomes of the exercise.
HOW
1. Start with a prompt. This could be a specific problem that needs to be solved, a challenge you
might be having with another person, or perhaps a plan to innovate. Having a prompt will help
guide your writing.
a. If you’re finding it difficult to write, Lumen Learning suggests that you begin with
a few questions:
i. What am I interested in? What do I care about?
ii. What do I know that I could teach others?
iii. What would I like to change about this issue?

2. Set a timer to write. Five to fifteen minutes should be enough time to get you started.
3. Don’t worry about grammar or sentence structure. Jot down any idea that comes to mind,
whether they're connected or not.
4. Don’t censor yourself. The purpose of this session is to get the mind thinking. Let yourself write
down feelings, ideas, or even rants you may have.
5. After you’ve run out of time or ideas, reread your passage and circle/highlight the ideas that
seem most useful.
6. Consider developing an outline or a plan from the most important ideas that surface.

One of the best ways to brainstorm, structure, and implement a vision, is by visually organizing its data and
information. To flesh out almost any multi-faceted or complex concept, ranging from product launches, to
organization charts, to the list of Oscar-nominated movies you haven’t seen yet, mind maps are your best
tool. There are a myriad of digital tools to brainstorm online, but using paper and pen is still one of the
foremost ways to help organize your thoughts and ideas.

Fishbone Diagram
A cause and effect diagram, often called a “fishbone” diagram or the “Ishikawa diagram” after its creator, can
help brainstorm possible causes of a problem by sorting ideas into overarching categories such as: people,
equipment, process, materials, management, or environment. Team members are directed to think of
alternative problem causes that may fall into these categories. This type of diagram is useful for
identifying causes that might otherwise be overlooked. It’s helpful to include all team members who have
personal knowledge of the processes and systems involved in the problem or event to be investigated. Even
people on the periphery may have insight that can be helpful here.
The original Ishikawa diagram:
CAUSE Effect
Equipment Process People
Problem
Secondary Cause
Primary Cause
Materials Environment Management
HOW
The problem or effect is displayed at the head or mouth of the fish. Possible contributing causes are
listed on the smaller “bones” under various cause categories. This diagram explores the problem of
bad coffee:

Rapid Ideation
This method of brainstorming is simple and easy to do. The team is given a prompt, and each person writes
down every idea that comes to mind as fast as they can, generating a list of ideas within a specific time period.
Having a set time for this ideation is important, as it creates a sense of urgency which can actually help you be
more creative.
A great way to do this is to hand everyone a pad of Post-it Notes. Set a timer for five or ten minutes, and have
people use the Post-its to write down all of their ideas. Once time is out, have them add their Post-it Notes to a
wall or a whiteboard for group discussion. Before doing this, it may be helpful to section off the whiteboard
into an impact/effort matrix:
IMPACT
Low effort, High effect,
High Impact High Impact
Low effort, High Effort,
Low Impact Low Impact
EFFORT
After everyone has placed their Post-it Notes, you can ask participants to vote on their favorites by placing
a sticker or drawing a check mark on the notes.

Why-Why & How-How
The ancient Greek philosopher Socrates is well known for his method of inquiry, which involves employing a
series of truth-seeking questions to identify and challenge one’s underlying assumptions. Over the last 2400
years, the idea of Socratic learning has prevailed; the belief that people have aptitudes and gifts that can be
nurtured through questioning, self-exploration and metacognition—in other words, thinking about one’s own
thinking. Socrates was a proponent of “anamnesis,” the idea of recollection or drawing upon the deeper
resources and hidden ideas within an individual. His method of inquiry was geared toward helping a person
explore deep-seeded thoughts and beliefs, and bringing them to new understandings. Socrates
accomplished this through a series of questions, asking over and over, “Why” and “How,” until the final truth
was revealed.
Using these diagrams is easy. In the first box put your question, which should begin with “Why,” or with
“How.” Answer the question two or three times. For each answer, ask “why” or “how” again. You can do this
multiple times until you feel like you have generated enough ideas. For example, in each of these stages, the
team asked “why?”
Not enough budget.

As you can see, one of the greatest strengths of these exercises is the way that they can be used to
determine the cause and effect of actions. You can do this exercise on paper, a whiteboard, or by using one
of the below templates.

Decision Tree Analysis
Let’s say you’re deciding whether to advertise your new campaign on Facebook using paid ads, or on
Instagram, using influencer sponsorships.
For the sake of simplicity, we’ll assume both options appeal to your ideal demographic and make sense
for your brand.
Here’s a preliminary decision tree you’d draw for your advertising campaign:
Advertising Campaign
FACEBOOK PAID ADS INSTAGRAM SPONSORSHIP
COST: $100 COST: $90
Success 50%: Failure 50%: Success 50%: Failure 50%:
+ $1,000 -$200 + $900 -$50
As you can see, you want to put your ultimate objective at the top -- in this case, Advertising Campaign is
the decision you need to make.
Next, you’ll need to draw arrows (your branches) to each potential action you could take (your leaves).
For our example, you only have two initial actions to take: Facebook Paid Ads, or Instagram Sponsorships.
Your tree might include multiple alternative options depending on the objective, however.
Now, you’ll want to draw branches and leaves to compare costs. In the example, these are the boxes for
Facebook Paid Ads and Instagram sponsorship. Then branches are added with additional information.
If this were the final step, the decision would be obvious: Instagram costs $10 less, so you’d likely
choose that.

Some small-business marketers may have difficulty relating to the SWOT's of a big brand like
Starbucks, so here's an example of how a restaurant might visualize each element:
STRENGTHS OPPORTUNITIES
1. World-class chefs 1. Solid current business location
2. Positive reviews 2. Ability to open more locations
3. Years of service 3. International cuisine is trendy on
social media
WEAKNESSES THREATS
1. We don’t offer delivery 1. New competitors are moving in next door
2. We’ve been told we’re pricier than 2. People will prefer delivery to dining in
competitors in our area
3. Meal prep services are teaching people
3. We haven’t added to the menu in years how to cook many of our menu items
from home
While a Thai or any other restaurant might not be as worried about high-level lawsuits like
Starbucks, small businesses might be more worried about competitors or disruptors entering the
playing field.
In another small-business example, a local boutique might be well known in its neighborhood, but
it also might take time to build an online presence or get its products in an online store. Because of
this, some of its strengths and opportunities might relate to physical factors, while weaknesses and
threats might relate to online situations.
STRENGTHS OPPORTUNITIES
1. Minimal local competition 1. Marketing on social media
2. Trust from customers and the 2. An online store could boost our revenue
neighborhood
3. Our location could pull in new foot traffic
3. Affordable prices
WEAKNESSES THREATS
1. Poor social media presence 1. Bad online reviews
2. No online ordering 2. Online Competitors
3. Dated styles and accessories 3. Could lose foot traffic due to dated
fashion
